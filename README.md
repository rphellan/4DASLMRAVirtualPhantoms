# 4D ASL MRA Virtual Phantoms

The programs included here should be used to generate the virtual phantoms described in the paper "A methodology for generating four-dimensional arterial spin labeling MR angiography virtual phantoms".

These programs require the ITK framework (https://itk.org/) to be properly installed in the system in order to be compiled.
